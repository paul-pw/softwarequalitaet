  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15153}, 
  DOI={10.48550/ARXIV.2012.15153}, 
  abstractNote={In this research paper of secure software systems, authors have discussed what the proper development process is when it comes to creating a secure software, which will be suited for developers and relevent stakeholders alike. Secure Software Development Process for Developers is of crucial importance for software engineers as more and more software-based devices are becoming commonly available, and cloud services are evolving which require for the software to be constantly connected to the internet. With this in mind, Secure Software Development needs to be transformed to something most developers can rely upon to make applied software safe and have the capability to mitigate against potential attacks by hackers. Furthermore, in this paper, existing Secure Software Development Process ideas and implementations are reviewed and investigated using the research paper pool available online. Thereafter, an approach is proposed to enhance the security aspect in software development process to resolve security issues. Lastly, the paper concludes with final remarks on practical implementation of security features in software development phases for production of secure and reliable software programs and systems.},
