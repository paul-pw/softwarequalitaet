  DOI={10.48550/ARXIV.2012.15153}, 
  abstractNote={In this research paper of secure software systems, authors have discussed what the proper development process is when it comes to creating a secure software, which will be suited for developers and relevent stakeholders alike. Secure Software Development Process for Developers is of crucial importance for software engineers as more and more software-based devices are becoming commonly available, and cloud services are evolving which require for the software to be constantly connected to the internet. With this in mind, Secure Software Development needs to be transformed to something most developers can rely upon to make applied software safe and have the capability to mitigate against potential attacks by hackers. Furthermore, in this paper, existing Secure Software Development Process ideas and implementations are reviewed and investigated using the research paper pool available online. Thereafter, an approach is proposed to enhance the security aspect in software development process to resolve security issues. Lastly, the paper concludes with final remarks on practical implementation of security features in software development phases for production of secure and reliable software programs and systems.},

  DOI={10.1145/3005714}, 
  abstractNote={Security metrics have received significant attention. However, they have not been systematically explored based on the understanding of attack-defense interactions, which are affected by various factors, including the degree of system vulnerabilities, the power of system defense mechanisms, attack (or threat) severity, and situations a system at risk faces. This survey particularly focuses on how a system security state can evolve as an outcome of cyber attack-defense interactions. This survey concerns how to measure system-level security by proposing a security metrics framework based on the following four sub-metrics: (1) metrics of system vulnerabilities, (2) metrics of defense power, (3) metrics of attack or threat severity, and (4) metrics of situations. To investigate the relationships among these four sub-metrics, we propose a hierarchical ontology with four sub-ontologies corresponding to the four sub-metrics and discuss how they are related to each other. Using the four sub-metrics, we discuss the state-of-art existing security metrics and their advantages and disadvantages (or limitations) to obtain lessons and insight in order to achieve an ideal goal in developing security metrics. Finally, we discuss open research questions in the security metrics research domain and we suggest key factors to enhance security metrics from a system security perspective.},
